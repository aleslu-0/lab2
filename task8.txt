	Reflection:
-------------------------------------------------------
"What did you learn? What did you know already?"
-Things that were new: Arrays in c++, vectors, switch case, creating libaries, random numbers, and how to solve these tasks.
-Things that I already knew: What was covered in lab1 and the previous corse, introduction to programming. 

-------------------------------------------------------
 "What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?"
-I'd say that most of the tasks required lots of thinking to implement. What was most difficult was understanding the errors that came up along the way. 
-Things such as vector changes not persisting, off by one, sizeof and strlen, and cases needing "{}" to work are examples of problems.
-I overcame these by using the lecture pdfs from this course, googling the problems and discussing/troubleshooting with my classmates.

-------------------------------------------------------
"How can the lab be improved?"
-The instructions on task 7 could have been more precise. A video or gif detailing the process would have helped understanding the task much simpler.
-The images added to the assignment aren't visible, they just appear as the names of images, not the actual images. 

-------------------------------------------------------
"Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab."
-Probably between 15 hours and 20 hours total.
